## Post 1: r/civilengineering

**Title:** I built a free browser-based Manning's equation solver — normal depth, critical depth, Froude number

**Body:**

I built manningcalc, a free web app for open channel flow calculations using Manning's equation. It solves for normal depth, critical depth, and Froude number across multiple cross-section shapes: trapezoid, rectangle, circle, triangle, and irregular sections.

Enter your channel geometry, slope, and roughness coefficient — it iteratively solves for depth and classifies the flow regime (subcritical, critical, supercritical). No more spreadsheet iteration or trial-and-error.

No install, no login, completely free. Open source too.

Would love to hear from hydraulics engineers — what features would you actually use?

## Post 2: r/hydrology

**Title:** Free open channel flow calculator — Manning's equation solver for trapezoidal, circular, irregular sections

**Body:**

Built a free browser-based tool for open channel hydraulics. It solves Manning's equation for normal depth iteratively, computes critical depth, and determines flow regime via Froude number.

Supports trapezoid, rectangle, circle, triangle, and irregular cross-sections with proper area/wetted perimeter/top width formulas for each.

No install, no account, works on any device. What would make this useful for your work?

## Post 3: r/engineering

**Title:** Free Manning's equation solver — open channel flow calculations in your browser

**Body:**

I'm building free engineering calculators that run in the browser. manningcalc solves Manning's equation for normal and critical depth across multiple channel shapes. It classifies flow regime and computes all the hydraulic parameters.

Use the web app directly for quick calculations and iteration.

Feedback welcome from anyone doing open channel design.

## Updated Post Footer (add to all posts)

> **A note on this project:** I'm a software engineer exploring what happens when you use AI to build professional tools in domains you're not an expert in. I've built 14 of these so far — across civil engineering, life sciences, optics, and petroleum engineering — and I'm documenting the journey.
>
> The biggest lesson: AI makes coding easy, but **domain expertise is irreplaceable.** These tools work, but they'd be *much* better if built by someone who actually works in this field. If you're a practitioner frustrated by expensive legacy tools, you might be surprised what you can build with AI now.
